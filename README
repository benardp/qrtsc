This is qrtsc, a port of rtsc (real-time suggestive contours) to Qt.

The original rtsc by Szymon Rusinkiewicz and Doug DeCarlo can be
found here:

HOW TO BUILD:

You need Qt 5.4 or higher installed. 

On Mac or Linux:

qmake -r qviewer.pro
make

On Windows:

Open the Qt command prompt, then

qmake -r qviewer.pro

Then open qviewer.sln from Visual Studio and build normally.

Tested on gcc + Ubuntu 10, gcc + Mac OSX 10.6, 
and Visual Studio 2008 + Windows 7.



HOW TO USE:

Like rtsc, simply pass a mesh at the command line. Qrtsc accepts
all types of meshes that rtsc does.


More documentation forthcoming at some point (maybe).
